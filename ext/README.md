# ext folder for projects using kubernetes playgound

External projects can create their own folder here.
The files and folders under `ext` are not visible by git.
Taking the kites project as an example, this is the recommended 
folder structure:

```
ext/kites
ext/kites/scripts
ext/kites/scripts/linux
```
